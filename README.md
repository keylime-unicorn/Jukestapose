## Motivation

Friends tend to study and do homework together often, at least from what we have observed from
our own personal experience. Lots of times we find ourselves sitting side by side, with our
headphones on, sending each other links to songs we are currently jamming out to. Occasionally,
actually way more than just occasionally, we find ourselves singing along to a song we are
listening to and have everyone join in. This prompts the immediate pausing of all other music
and the unplugging of the headphones currently transferring the signal of the current jam. How 
much easier would it be if we could all just add our songs to a collective queue that would play
each song choice from each person's queue in a round robin fashion from one central set of
speakers? 

Hence the ___LUG Modern Jukebox___ was born!
